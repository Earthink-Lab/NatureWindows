## NatureWindows - countless heart software, a source of care.

## Official website: naturewindows.earthink.top

# Project overview

## Goal and vision

NatureWindows is a platform for Windows users to find and download high quality and clean applications. We won't put in any commercial advertisement and induced download button, and we won't be as hooligan as anything in "Huajun software centre". We hope to be a better platform for application search and download than Guoheboke.

This project is to solve the most difficult problems of those wonderful download stations on the Chinese Internet, such as advertising and induced links. We provide a simple and bright solution, so that users can easily find the software they want, without any trouble.
